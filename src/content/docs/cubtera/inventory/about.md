Cubtera enables teams to build, deploy and manage cloud infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform, OpenTofu, Helm and others.

Infrastructure as Code is hard and complex - we get it!

Cubtera helps you to overcome this by providing a next-generation Infrastructure as Code management tool that runs natively in your existing CI/CD system.

Using Cubtera makes it possible to:

- Streamline configuration management and environments: Cubtera enables you to manage environments and services with `dimensions` and adds code generation to keep configuration DRY, which means you can easily provision multiple services and environments and avoid manual copy & paste of duplicate configuration files with different values.
- Enable better collaboration, governance, observability and drift control: Cubtera adds a powerful suite of features to improve the developer experience when working with infrastructure as code such as plan previews, policies, observability, notifications, SlackOps, automated drift detection and reconciliation, which means better productivity, fewer failures and more stable infrastructure.
