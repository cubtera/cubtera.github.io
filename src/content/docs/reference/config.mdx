## Configuration file

&emsp; Cubtera configuration file is a `config.toml` file, which should be placed by default path `~/.cubtera/config.toml`. This file contains all cubtera configuration parameters, which could be used to configure cubtera behavior. If you want to use custom configuration file, you can set it with environment variable `CUBTERA_CONFIG`.

Configuration parameters priority is as follows:
1. Values from `env` variables
2. Values from `org` lvl configuration
3. Values from `default` lvl configuration

### Example of `config.toml` file

```toml title="config.toml"
[ default ] # all parameters are optional, default values are shown
workspace_path = "example" # default => "~/.cubtera"
temp_folder_path = "example/.cubtera/tmp" # default => "~/.cubtera/tmp"

units_folder = "units" # default => "units"
modules_folder = "modules" # default => "modules"
inventory_folder = "inventory" # default => "inventory"

units_path = "example/units" # $workspace_path/$units_folder | override units_folder
modules_path = "example/modules" # $workspace_path/$modules_folder | override modules_folder
inventory_path = "example/inventory" # $workspace_path/$inventory_folder | override inventory_folder

dim_relations = "dome:env:dc" # default => "dome:env:dc" | Relations of base dimension's types (colon separated)
orgs = "cubtera:teracub" # default => "cubtera" | List of orgs (tenants) in inventory to work with (colon separated)

# Usefully for development and CI/CD
always_copy_files = true # default => "false" | Copy files to the runner's temp folder
clean_cache = false # default => "false" | Clean runner's temp folder after successful run

[ cubtera ] # optional, custom configuration for the org, overrides default parameters with the same key
# usefully for multiple orgs management in the same inventory

[cubtera.state.s3] # optional, global org configuration for the state backend of S3 type
bucket = "{{ org }}-example-state"
key    = "{{ dim_tree }}/{{ unit_name }}.tfstate"
region = "us-east-1"

[cubtera.state.local] # optional, global org configuration for the state backend of local type
path = "~/.cubtera/state/{{ org }}/{{ dim_tree }}/{{ unit_name }}.tfstate" # default

[cubtera.runner.tf] # optional, custom configuration for the runner of Terraform type
state_backend = "s3" # default => "local"

[cubtera.runner.tofu] # optional, custom configuration for the runner of Terraform type
state_backend = "s3"

inlet_command = "echo Inlet command" # default => None, will run command before runner starts, in temp folder context
outlet_command = "echo Outlet command" # default => None, will run command after runner finishes successfully, in temp folder context

version = "1.7.0" # default => latest, will be ignored if runner_command is set, will be latest if both was not defined

# runner_command = "terraform" # default => None, if None -> will proceed with internal runner logic
# extra_params = "-json" # default => None, will add extra params to the runner_command

[cubtera.runner.bash]
runner_command = "./runner.sh"

## Org specific parameters, override defaults
[ teracub ] # optional, custom configuration for the org, overrides default parameters with the same key

dim_relations = "universe:environment:dc"

[teracub.state.s3] # optional, global org configuration for the state backend of S3 type
bucket = "{{ org }}-tfstates"
key    = "{{ dim_tree }}/{{ unit_name }}.tfstate"
region = "us-west-2"

[teracub.runner.tf] # optional, custom configuration for the runner of Terraform type
state_backend = "s3" # default => "local"

```

### Inventory parameters
- `workspace_path` - path to your workspace, where all your terraform states will be stored, default is `~/.cubtera/workspace`
- `module_path` - path to your modules, where all your terraform modules will be stored, default is `~/.cubtera/workspace/modules`. This modules folder will be symlinked to every terraform unit folder, so you can use modules in your units without any additional configuration, just install them in this folder, and they will be available in every unit by path `./modules`
- `plugin_path` - path to your plugins, where all your terraform plugins will be stored, default is `~/.cubtera/workspace/plugins`. This plugins folder will be symlinked to every terraform unit folder, so you can use plugins in your units without any additional configuration, just install them in this folder, and they will be available in every unit by path `./plugins`
- `inventory_path` - path to your inventory, where all your terraform inventory will be stored, default is `~/.cubtera/workspace/inventory`. This should contain all your terraform units, which will be used in your infrastructure. Every unit should be placed in separate folder, and should contain `main.tf` file with terraform code, and `unit_manifest.json` file with unit configuration.
- `temp_folder_path` - path to your temp files, where all your terraform temp files will be stored, default is `~/.cubtera/temp`

&emsp; Path could be set as absolute or relative to your current working directory, if you want to use relative path, you should start it with `./`.

### Dimension's relations parameters

- `dim_relations` - configure relations between base dimensions, default is `dome:env:dc`. String, with every `dim_type`s separated by `:`. Elders first. For example, `[dome:env:dc]` means that `dome`dimension is a parent of `env`, as well as `env` is a parent of `dc`.

&emsp; This relation's definition will be used to provide a right variables set for a unit, depending on a used dimension. If unit uses `dc` dimension as a main, it will get all variables from `dc` dimension, and all variables from parent dimension of `env` type, and all variables from parent dimension of `dome` type.

:::note
Cubtera currently supports only one relations line, so you can't use many relations, e.g. `dome:env:dc` and `entity:service:app` simultaneously in one config.
:::

&emsp; Dimension parent should be also defined in `dc` dimension .json file, for example, if you want to use `env` dimension as a parent for `dc` dimension, you should define which exactly `env` dimension is parent:
```json
// inventory/dc/staging1-us-e2.json | dc:staging1-us-e2 dimension
{
   ...
   "parent": "env:staging1",
   ...
}
```

&emsp; more about dimension's `json` definition you can read [here]()

### Development parameters
- `clean_cache` - cleaning cash after successful apply toggle, default is `false`.
- `always_copy_files` - unit files copying to cache folder for every command, default is `false`. If enabled, all unit files will be copied to cache folder before every command, if disabled, files will be copied only for `init` command.

### Deployment log parameters
- `dlog_db` - configures mongo database connection string, if not set, deployment log will be disabled
- `dlog_job_user_name_env` - configures environment variable name, which will be used to store job user name, if not set, will be used local host user name
- `dlog_job_number_env` - configures environment variable name, which will be used to store job number, if not set, will be set to `0`
- `dlog_job_name_env` - configures environment variable name, which will be used to store job name, if not set, will be set to `local`

## Overrides with env variables

&emsp; Cubtera can be configured using environment variables, which override configuration file parameters. All environment variables should:
- Start with the `CUBTERA_` prefix
- Be in uppercase

&emsp; For example, to override the `workspace_path` parameter, set the environment variable `CUBTERA_WORKSPACE_PATH`.

&emsp; Additional configuration options:
- To use a custom configuration file, set the `CUBTERA_CONFIG` environment variable.
- In a `multi-organization` setup, switch organizations by setting the `CUBTERA_ORG` environment variable. This will be used to find your organization-related config parameters, units, and dimensions in the inventory.
